Full AIES & AIES_Continued Installation Instructions

Due to license restrictions, the AIES mod cannot be distributed with this mod

There are two ways to install the AIES mod for 1.8.1.  The first is a direct
download and manual install, the second is using CKAN


Recommended method to install is via CKAN.

CKAN Install
============
The last version of the mod was for KSP 1.0.5.  You will need to change a
setting in CKAN to allow it to be downloaded.  Follow these steps:

1.  At the main CKAN window, type AIES in the entry field for "Filter by mod name"
2.  You will see three lines for "AIES Patches"
3.  Select "AIES Patches"
4.  Now select one of the other two configs for the antenna settings you want
     (see included spreadsheet for a comparision)
5.  Click "Apply Changes" and wait for the mod & patches to be installed


Note that because the AIES mod is not compatible beyond 1.0.5, the "AIES Continued" 
will not have AIES as a dependency.


Manual Install
==============
Download the full AIES version 1.6.1 from Curse here: 

	https://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods/aies/download

This link will download the file after a 5 second countdown.  You will then
need to install the mod by hand the normal way.


There are three folders inside the AIES_Continued folder.  They are:

DeimosRast	Antenna patches from DeimosRast
TK421d		Antenna patches derived from TK421d's AIES Antenna Revamp thread
Patches		The rest of the patches from DemiosRast

Note that the DeimosRast and TK421 folder conflict with each other.

Copy the entire AIES_Continued folder to the GameData directory
Delete one of these folders:
	AIES_Continued/DemiosRast
	AIES_Continued/TK421d
