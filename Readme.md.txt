This is a compilation of several people's work.  First off, Demios Rast compiled the main set of patches, see below for his comments
related to credits.

TK421d did a rebalance on the antennas January 29,2017, thread is here: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155752-*
I have taken his changes, which were actually complete config files, and converted them to MM patches.  Also, since the
changes from Demios Rast were more up-to-date than TK421d, I kept the main section of the part configs from the Demios Rast
changes, and only changed the antenna ranges.

See the file INSTALL.txt for instructions on installation

This was the one most in line with the original mod (ie:  No Commercial) and
the original makes of the patches

The majority of these patches were compiled by Deimos Rast, but represent a community effort.
Special thanks goes out to COL.R.Neville and MeCripp for their assistance, as well as to those who
provided patches in the past. You made this much easier than it otherwise would have been - much appreciated!
